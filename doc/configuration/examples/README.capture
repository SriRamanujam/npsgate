NpsGate Example Configuration 'Capture'
=======================================
This example shows how NpsGate's pipeline can be used duplicate packets
and have them processed along two different paths. The NFQueue plugin
captures only packets with a source or destination port 80. Thise packets
are forwarded to the Duplicate plugin. The Duplicate plugin copies a packet
and transmits a copy to each configured output, in this case to the IPOutput
plugin and the PCAPOutput plugin. The IPOutput plugin uses the host operating
system to transmit packets over the wire. The PCAPOutput plugin writes packets
to a PCAP file using libpcap.
